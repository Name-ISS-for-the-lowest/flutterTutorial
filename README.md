# tuto2

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Hi I made this project to practice flutter,
by following a tutorial, and added it to an organization repo.

Here's the link to the tutorial

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4nhaszNW4o

-the default branch of this repo is restricted

-here is how to clone the repo an create a new branch
-under your name

```
git clone [thisRepo]
```

```
git checkout -b [yourName]
```

```
git add .
```

```
git commit . "[comment]"
```

```
git push --set-upstream origin [yourName]
```

FROM SCRATCH

if you want to do the tutorial from scratch create your own empty flutter project and run
this commands on the root dir.

```
git init
```

```
git checkout -b [yourname]
```

```
git remote add origin [thisRepo]
```

```
git add .
```

```
git commit -m "[comment]"
```

```
git push --set-upstream origin [yourName]
```
